# Key Value Proposition
%% Write summary of what the section describes   %%

Write a series of briefs that capture the founders’ hours of thinking, talking, and brainstorming about the product in three separate, specific areas:
1) [[#Product Vision]]: This portion of the value proposition brief captures your vision for what you want your successful company to become.
2) [[#Product Features & Benefits]]: This portion of the value proposition brief captures what the product is and why people will use or buy it.
3) [[#Low-Fidelity MVP]]: The MVP brief is a concise summary of the low fidelity web/mobile features that will work as a stand-alone product.

==Checklists:==
- [ ] [[04. Product Vision]]
- [ ] [[05. Product Features And Benefits]]

### Product Vision
%% 
Over time, successful companies are usually more than a single product.
- What’s your long-term vision for your company? 
- What do you want to ultimately change? 
- Are you going to do it with a series of products? 
- How do you expand into adjacent markets? How do you get people to change behavior?
- What’s the world look like three years after you arrive on the scene? 
- Five years after?
Shape a long-term vision with a short narrative told in bullet points.

**Product Narrative:**



%% 
This portion of the value proposition brief captures what the product is and why people will use or buy it.

While many engineers think new products are all about product features, the product is just one of many elements of a successful startup. The product features list is a one-page document consisting of one- or two-sentence summaries **of the top 10 (or fewer) features** of the complete product vision. (If there’s some ambiguity in describing a particular feature, include a reference to a more detailed engineering document.)

Essentially, the feature list is Product Development’s contract with the rest of the company. The biggest challenge will be deciding what features will ship in what order. Developing the MVP will start the prioritization process. Once you get out of the building, customers will guide the process as they begin interacting with the earliest version of the MVP.

**Think of features as the things engineering is building, and think of benefits as the problem you’re solving for the customer.**

## Hypotheses
---
Attempting to answer the key question: =="What is the smallest or least complicated problem that a customer will pay us to solve?"==


## Key Pass-Fail Tests
---


Where do we put failed/updated hypotheses?
How do we indicate how they failed?

How might we link hypotheses with the tests they pass/fail?
Problem: "Hypothesis" should be immutable, but we should be able to add + update the tests and their results to tie-in with the hypothesis. Neither is as useful when used individually.
