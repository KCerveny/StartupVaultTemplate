# Market Type and Competitive Hypothesis
%% Write summary of what the section describes   %%
The market-type brief describes which of the four market types the company fits into:
1) Existing market
2) Re-segmenting an existing market
3) Creating a new market
4) Cloning a market
For most startups, the market type is a "late-binding" decision.

## Section Brief

%% Here, insert relevant analysis about the given business model section.  %%
When re-segmenting an existing market, positioning rests on either:
1. Finding a unique niche where some product feature or service redefines the market, creating a clear competitive advantage
2. Being the “low-cost provider”
3. Combining differentiation and lower operating cost into a Blue Ocean Strategy that creates an uncontested market space and makes the competition irrelevant while creating and capturing new demand.

## Hypotheses

- [[H005. Market Type - Furniture Board Affiliate Re-Segment]]: We are a re-segmentation of the multi-sided consumer, influencer, affiliate brand market intersection, positioned towards furniture.

**When re-segmenting for a unique niche, address these questions in this brief:**
- What existing markets are customers coming from?
- What are the unique characteristics of those customers?
- What compelling needs of those customers are unmet by existing suppliers?
- What compelling product features will get customers to abandon their current suppliers?
- Why couldn’t existing companies offer the same thing?
- How long will it take you to grow a market of sufficient size? What size?
- How will the company educate the market and create demand?
- Given that no customers yet exist in the new segment, what are realistic sales forecasts?
- How can this forecast be tested?
- Can parts of the business model be changed to differentiate the company?
## Key Pass-Fail Tests

Where do we put failed/updated hypotheses?
How do we indicate how they failed?

How might we link hypotheses with the tests they pass/fail?
Problem: "Hypothesis" should be immutable, but we should be able to add + update the tests and their results to tie-in with the hypothesis. Neither is as useful when used individually.
