# Key Partnerships

%% Write summary of what the section describes   %%
The key-partners hypothesis names the essential partners your company will require, along with the “value exchange” with each one (as in “we give them money, they send us customers”). 

Partnerships generally fall into four key areas: 
1. Strategic alliances
2. “Coopetition,” or cooperation between competitors 
3. Joint new business development efforts
4. Key supplier relationships
5. Traffic Partners (Web only)

Think of this hypothesis as a simple three-column spreadsheet:

| Partner Name | What they provide | What we provide           |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Example A    | Affiliate revenue | Data, traffic, visibility |

## Key Pass-Fail Tests
---


Where do we put failed/updated hypotheses?
How do we indicate how they failed?

How might we link hypotheses with the tests they pass/fail?
Problem: "Hypothesis" should be immutable, but we should be able to add + update the tests and their results to tie-in with the hypothesis. Neither is as useful when used individually.
