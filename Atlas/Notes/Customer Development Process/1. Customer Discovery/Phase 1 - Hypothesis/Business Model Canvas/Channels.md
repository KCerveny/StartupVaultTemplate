## Hypotheses

## Key Pass-Fail Tests
---


Where do we put failed/updated hypotheses?
How do we indicate how they failed?

How might we link hypotheses with the tests they pass/fail?
Problem: "Hypothesis" should be immutable, but we should be able to add + update the tests and their results to tie-in with the hypothesis. Neither is as useful when used individually.
