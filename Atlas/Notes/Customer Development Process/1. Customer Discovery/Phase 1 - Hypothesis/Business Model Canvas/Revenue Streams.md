# Revenue Streams

%% Write summary of what the section describes   %%

## Section Brief
---
%% Here, insert relevant analysis about the given business model section.  %%
This brief is important, as it ensures the business model makes sense. It asks only four questions:
1. How many of these things will we sell?
2. What’s the revenue model?
3. How much will we charge?
4. Does this add up to a business that’s worth doing?

### Revenue Streams Overview
%% Insert bullet points here %%


## Hypotheses
---
### Question 1: How Many Will We Sell?
%% 
Can be generated from previous revenue stream components:
- **Market size and market share hypotheses**, which should translate into the anticipated number of customers (as in 10 percent of a million-person market = 100,000 customers)
- **Channel hypotheses**, along with estimates of their volume potential and
channel costs 
- Be sure to **include (subtract, really) the channel’s cost of sales**, which can be enormous, since the company only gets to “count,” or keep, net revenue received after channel costs are subtracted. (Enthusiastic entrepreneurs make this mistake far too often)
%%

### Question 2: What’s the Revenue Model?
Direct revenue sources include: 
- Sales
- Subscriptions
- Pay-per-use
- Referral revenue
- Affiliate revenue (revenue sharing)
- E-mail list rentals
- Back-end offers
- Other 


### Question 3: How Much Do We Charge? (Pricing Tactics)
%% 
This is a two-part question. Part one assesses the costs of doing business.
1) What are the costs of doing business?
2) What is the price?

A good pricing model recognizes Market Type, accommodates manufacturing
costs, the value the product delivers, market beliefs, and competitive prices. It
also charges “as much as the market will bear” to maximize profits.
%%

Popular pricing models:
- Value pricing
- Competitive pricing
- Volume pricing
- Portfolio pricing
- The “razor/razor blade” model
- Subscription
- Leasing
- Product-based pricing
- Other

### Question 4: Do Revenues Point to a Business Worth Doing?
%% 
Make a rough computation of the following:
- Is the revenue adequate to cover costs in the short term?
- Will the revenue grow materially if not dramatically over time?
- Does the profitability get better as the revenues get bigger?
%%

## Key Pass-Fail Tests
---


Where do we put failed/updated hypotheses?
How do we indicate how they failed?

How might we link hypotheses with the tests they pass/fail?
Problem: "Hypothesis" should be immutable, but we should be able to add + update the tests and their results to tie-in with the hypothesis. Neither is as useful when used individually.
