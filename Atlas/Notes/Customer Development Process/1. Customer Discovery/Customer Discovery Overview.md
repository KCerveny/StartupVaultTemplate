# Customer Discovery Process
The Customer Discovery Process is used to "see whether there’s product/market fit by finding earlyvangelists, understanding their needs, and verifying that the initial minimum viable product solves a problem they’ll eagerly pay to have solved. 
And if not, use near-continuous customer feedback to drive agile, frequent changes in product and business model alike."

In completing hypothesis development, we will make  3 main canvases at once:
1) **Core elements of business model** itself (value prop, channel, etc.)
2) **Hypotheses you have for each element** of the business model (such as “people will want these features, “or “customers will buy our product because…”)
3) **Key pass/fail tests** you will use to get face-to-face with customers and use their feedback to convert your hypotheses into facts.

Customer Discovery has Four Phases:
1) **Phase 1**: deconstructs the founders’ vision into the nine parts of the business
model canvas, write 1 page briefs for each, and pass/fail tests for hypotheses.
2) **Phase 2**: you conduct experiments to test your “problem” hypotheses.
3) **Phase 3**: you test your “solution,” presenting your value proposition and MVP to customers, testing against "pass/fail" goals developed
4) **Phase 4**: you stop and assess the results of the experiments you’ve conducted
