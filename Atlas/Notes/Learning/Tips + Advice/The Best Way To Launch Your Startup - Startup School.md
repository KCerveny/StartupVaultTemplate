## Notes
### When do I launch?
- Right away
- Continuously
	- Multiple times, *especially* if it goes unnoticed the first time
		- If people don't care, then we should iterate
	- Do NOT need just one "perfect" launch
	- Speed over perfection
- It is much better to make 100 users *very* happy than thousands just satisfied

### What do I need to launch?
- ==Build a simple one sentence pitch==
	- ==**Implies clarity of vision**==
	- Can be understood by a 5 year old
	- Implied founder has thought deeply about the problem
	- A clear idea is the best foundation for growth
- Create a Short Memorable Description
	- Helps users describe your product -> more word-of-mouth spreading
	- Make it easy for the general public to talk about you
	- Start with **what** not **why**
		- Give someone context upfront
		- Can discuss the "why" in follow-up questions
	- Give someone an idea of what they would need to build to replicate your company
- Avoid an "X for Y" construction
	- Unless X is a household name
	- People should want X
	- Y should be a massive market

How to write a pitch:
- Descriptive
- Conversational
- No jargon
- No preamble
- Concise (1 sentence)

Why Launch Continuously?
- A/B test your short pitch
- See how users respond to product
- Launching to different audiences
### Types of Launches
- Silent Launch
	- Domain name
	- Company name
	- Short description
	- Contact info
	- Call to action
- Friends & Family
	- Ask them for feedback
	- Don't stay in this space too long
- Launch to Strangers
	- Approaching small businesses - can get new ideas from strangers
	- Much less time waiting for direct feedback from customers
- Online Communities
	- Be authentic, get genuinely involved in these communities
	- "Book Face" - other founders
	- Hacker News
	- Reddit sub-communities
- Waitlist Launch
	- The longer you wait, harder to convert to users
