# Build In Public: A Good Idea?

## Intro
I have seen glimpses of the hashtag #build_in_public bouncing around on reddit as I have been looking for insights on how to get started. Although I find the idea interesting, I am repulsed by what I perceive to be some of the more fundamental drawbacks. Would this invite more competition? Will it take extra time and effort to maintain? Will I look foolish? Am I comfortable sharing my journey with the world wide web?

I don't have answers to these yet. But I am seriously considering giving this strategy a shot. Why? Because it is scary. Because I am (currently) alone on this journey. Because I think it will help me set smarter goals, hold myself accountable, and force me to articulate *why* I am making certain decisions. For me. If other people can get some benefit from this, then great!

## SWOT
After talking with my significant other last night about the idea, I decided it may be best to draft up a [SWOT analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp) about this idea to weigh it out.
