### Problem Recognition Scale
%% Understand the intensity of the pain this problem causes our customers %%

How strongly does this customer identify this problem?
- [ ] a *latent problem*: they have a problem but don’t know it
- [ ] a *passive problem*: they know of the problem but aren’t motivated or aware of the opportunity to change
- [ ] an *active (or urgent) problem*: they recognize a problem or passion and are searching for a solution but haven’t done any serious work to solve the problem
- [ ] *a vision*: they have an idea for solving the problem and even have cobbled together a home-grown solution, but are prepared to pay for a better one

### Problem + Passions Motivations
%% 
- Is your product solving a mission-critical company problem or satisfying a must-have consumer need? 
- Is your product a must-have or a nice-to-have? When your product solves a problem that costs customers sleep, revenue, or profits, things are definitely looking up.
- Have customers tried to build a solution for themselves?
- What are the emotional wants and desires that are addressed with this product?
